Let me start by recalling what I know about that event. Apollo 11 was the first mission to land humans on the Moon, right? It took place in July 1969. \n\nNow, the presidents before and after July 1969... I think Nixon was president around then. Wait, wasn't there something about him being involved in the space race? Maybe he was responsible for the Apollo program? I remember hearing his name connected to the moon landing. But let me double-check.\n\nLet's break it down step by step. First, the moon landing was in July 1969. Before that, Kennedy had set the goal of landing on the Moon by the end of the decade (1969), which he announced in May 1961. So from 1961 onwards, different administrations handled the Apollo program. Eisenhower was president until 1961 when JFK became president. Then LBJ was president in the mid-60s but not during the actual landing because he left office in 1969. Then Nixon became president in 1969. So between 1961 and 1969, the key figures were JFK and then Nixon. Since the Apollo 11 mission occurred during Nixon's presidency, he must have been president at the time. \n\nBut wait, some people might confuse Richard Nixon with another president. Let me confirm: Nixon was indeed president during the Apollo 11 mission. The exact date is July 20, 1969. If I recall correctly, he made a famous phone call to Armstrong after the successful landing. That's a key point. Also, the Apollo 11 mission included Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as astronauts, and they became famous for their quotes like \"That's one small step for man\" and \"The Eagle has landed.\"\n\nAnother angle: the administration overseeing the Apollo program would be the current president. Since the landing happened in 1969, the president was Nixon. There's no doubt here. Let me check if there was any other president during those years. From 1961 to 1969, it's Eisenhower (1953-1961), JFK (1961-1963, but he died in 1963; his vice president was Lyndon B. Johnson), then LBJ (1963-1969). After 1969, it's Nixon until 1974.",
