Let me start by recalling what I know. Apollo 11 was one of the early missions in the Apollo program, right? The moon landing happened in 1969. Now, presidents in the 60s... Lyndon B. Johnson was president when Kennedy died, but he only served until 1969. Then there's Richard Nixon, who came after him. Wait, Nixon was elected in 1968 and took office in January 1969. So if the moon landing was in July 1969, that would be during his term. Let me check the exact date: July 20, 1969. Yeah, that's right. So Nixon was president at that time.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should cross-verify. LBJ was president from 1963 to 1969, so he wouldn't have been around for the Apollo 11 mission. Nixon's presidency started in 1969, so he was definitely in charge when the landing happened. Also, the speech where Nixon addressed the country after the moon landing is famous; he congratulated Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. That's a key point because it confirms the timing. I think Nixon did make that speech. So putting it all together, the answer should be Richard Nixon.\n</think>\n\nThe United States President during the Apollo 11 moon landing on **July 20, 1969**, was **Richard Nixon**. He assumed the presidency on January 20, 1969, and remained in office until his resignation in August 1974. During the historic mission, Nixon delivered a televised address to the nation following the successful lunar landing, acknowledging Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins as part of a pivotal moment in U.S. history.",
